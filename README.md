## Introduction

The Digit GAN generator is a type of generative model that uses a deep neural network to generate synthetic images that resemble handwritten digits. It is trained in an adversarial manner alongside a discriminator network, which aims to distinguish between real and fake images.

The generator model is implemented using PyTorch, a popular deep learning library, and consists of several fully connected layers and activation functions. It takes a random noise vector as input and outputs a generated digit image.

## Dependencies

To run the Digit GAN generator, you need the following dependencies:

- Python (3.7 or above)
- PyTorch (1.8.1 or above)
- NumPy (1.19.5 or above)
- Matplotlib (3.4.2 or above)

You can install these dependencies using pip by running the following command:

```
pip install torch numpy matplotlib
```




## Results

The `output` directory contains example outputs from the generator model. You can find generated digit images saved as PNG files in this directory.
